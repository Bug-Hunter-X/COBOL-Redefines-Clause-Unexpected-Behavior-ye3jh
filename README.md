This example demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs related to the use of the REDEFINES clause. The program initializes a field within a redefined area. However, accessing the original field shows the changes from the redefined field, and accessing the redefined fields after changes in the original field shows unexpected results. This behavior can lead to subtle and hard-to-detect bugs if not handled carefully.
